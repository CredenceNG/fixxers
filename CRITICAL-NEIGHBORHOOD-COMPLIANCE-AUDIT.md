# Critical Neighborhood Compliance Audit

## Database Schema Analysis

### ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLIANT (Using Normalized Structure)

#### 1. ServiceRequest (Line 451-489)
```prisma
neighborhoodId    String
neighborhood      Neighborhood  @relation(fields: [neighborhoodId], references: [id])
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ PERFECT - Using proper foreign key relationship
**Impact:** Service requests are properly linked to neighborhoods
**No Action Required**

#### 2. FixerService (Line 428-449)
```prisma
neighborhoods   Neighborhood[]  // Many-to-many relationship
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ PERFECT - Using proper many-to-many relationship
**Impact:** Fixers can serve multiple neighborhoods
**No Action Required**

#### 3. Agent (Line 1071-1121)
```prisma
approvedNeighborhoods Neighborhood[]  @relation("AgentNeighborhoods")
requestedNeighborhoodIds String[]      @default([])
```
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è HYBRID - Uses both normalized and legacy approaches
**Issue:** `requestedNeighborhoodIds` is a String array (legacy)
**Impact:** Agent applications and territory management
**Action Required:** Update agent application flow to use `approvedNeighborhoods` relation

#### 4. Quote (Line 491-537)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLIANT - Inherits neighborhood from ServiceRequest
**Flow:** Quote ‚Üí ServiceRequest ‚Üí Neighborhood
**No Action Required**

#### 5. Order (Line 539-625)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLIANT - Inherits neighborhood from ServiceRequest or Gig
**Flow:** Order ‚Üí ServiceRequest/Gig ‚Üí Neighborhood
**No Action Required**

## API Endpoints Audit

### ‚ùå BROKEN - Need Immediate Fix

#### 1. Service Request Creation
**Files:**
- `app/client/requests/new/page.tsx` - Client creates service request
- `app/agent/clients/[id]/request/new/CreateRequestForm.tsx` - Agent creates for client
- `app/api/client/service-requests/route.ts` - API endpoint

**Issue:** Forms likely use legacy string fields, API expects `neighborhoodId`
**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Users cannot create service requests
**Fix Required:**
1. Update forms to use cascading dropdowns (Country ‚Üí State ‚Üí City ‚Üí Neighborhood)
2. Submit `neighborhoodId` instead of legacy fields
3. Update API to validate `neighborhoodId` exists

#### 2. Fixer Profile & Services
**Files:**
- `app/fixer/services/page.tsx` - Fixer manages service areas
- `app/api/fixer/services/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `app/api/fixer/profile/route.ts` - Profile API

**Issue:** Forms use legacy fields, need to save `neighborhoodId` to profile
**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Fixers cannot set service areas
**Fix Required:**
1. Update UnifiedProfileForm to save `neighborhoodId`
2. Update FixerService creation to use neighborhood many-to-many
3. Fix matching algorithm to use normalized neighborhoods

#### 3. Client Profile
**Files:**
- `app/profile/UnifiedProfileForm.tsx` - Profile form
- `app/api/client/profile/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `app/api/profile/route.ts` - Unified profile API

**Issue:** Forms submit legacy fields (neighbourhood, city, state, country)
**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Clients cannot save location properly
**Fix Required:**
1. Update form to use cascading dropdowns
2. Submit `neighborhoodId`
3. Update API to save to `neighborhoodId` field

#### 4. Agent Registration & Territory
**Files:**
- `app/agent/application/AgentApplicationForm.tsx` - Agent applies
- `app/api/agent/application/route.ts` - Application API
- `app/admin/agents/[agentId]/approve/route.ts` - Approval API

**Issue:** Uses `requestedNeighborhoodIds` (String array) instead of relation
**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Agent territory management broken
**Fix Required:**
1. Update Agent schema to use `requestedNeighborhoods` relation
2. Update application form to select from normalized neighborhoods
3. Update approval flow to link `approvedNeighborhoods`

---

## Matching & Search Algorithms

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. Fixer-Request Matching
**File:** `lib/matching.ts` or wherever AI matching happens
**Issue:** Matching algorithm likely compares string-based locations
**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Fixers not matched to requests in their area
**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// OLD (Broken)
fixer.neighbourhood === request.neighbourhood

// NEW (Fixed)
fixerService.neighborhoods.some(n => n.id === request.neighborhoodId)
```

#### 2. Search & Filtering
**Files:**
- `app/gigs/page.tsx` - Gig search
- `app/admin/requests/page.tsx` - Admin request search
- Any search/filter components

**Issue:** Filters likely use legacy string fields
**Impact:** üü° **HIGH** - Search results incorrect
**Fix Required:** Update filters to use neighborhood relationships

---

## Quote & Order Flow Analysis

### ‚úÖ Quote Flow (Compliant)
```
Client creates ServiceRequest with neighborhoodId
  ‚Üì
Fixer sees request (matched by neighborhood)
  ‚Üì
Fixer creates Quote for ServiceRequest
  ‚Üì
Quote inherits neighborhood from ServiceRequest
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ Will work once ServiceRequest creation is fixed

### ‚úÖ Order Flow (Compliant)
```
Client accepts Quote
  ‚Üì
Order created with reference to Quote/ServiceRequest
  ‚Üì
Order inherits neighborhood through relationships
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ Will work once ServiceRequest creation is fixed

---

## Critical Fix Priority

### üî¥ PRIORITY 1 (Blocking Core Features)
1. **ServiceRequest Creation API** - Users cannot create requests
   - Fix: `app/api/client/service-requests/route.ts`
   - Fix: `app/client/requests/new/page.tsx`
   - Fix: `app/agent/clients/[id]/request/new/CreateRequestForm.tsx`

2. **Fixer Profile & Services** - Fixers cannot set service areas
   - Fix: `app/api/fixer/profile/route.ts`
   - Fix: `app/api/fixer/services/route.ts`
   - Fix: `app/fixer/services/page.tsx`

3. **Matching Algorithm** - Requests not matched to fixers
   - Fix: AI matching logic to use normalized neighborhoods
   - Fix: Quote generation to respect neighborhood boundaries

### üü° PRIORITY 2 (High Impact)
4. **Client Profile** - Clients cannot save location
   - Fix: `app/api/profile/route.ts`
   - Fix: `app/profile/UnifiedProfileForm.tsx`

5. **Agent Territory** - Agents cannot manage territory
   - Fix: Agent schema to use `requestedNeighborhoods` relation
   - Fix: `app/agent/application/AgentApplicationForm.tsx`
   - Fix: Admin approval flow

### üü¢ PRIORITY 3 (Lower Impact)
6. **Search & Filters** - Results may be inaccurate
7. **Admin Tools** - Legacy field cleanup
