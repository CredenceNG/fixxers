need to add a feature - Agents

Agent is a new type of user

Agent register through a different flow for registration, into a different table called agents, even if you are a Client or Fixer or both, you have to register as an agent seperately (the idea is not to convolute the existing system)
Agents Profile needs to be approved by the Admin in order to be Active.
Agents are restricted to a set of neigbourhood, as approved and any change to profile or neighbourhood will trigger additional approval

Agents:
Can register and manage a set of Fixers and Clients (after registration, fixers and users can login on their own)
Vet Fixers profile before the Admin can approve
Fixers registered by agents still need to be approved by the Admin before they can use the system as defined already)
Can post Service Offers on behalf of their Fixers
Can post respond to service requests on behalf of there fixers
May earn commiion on completed orders (depending on platform setting)
Can post service requests on behalf of their Clients
Can be Suspended or banned
May earn money per Fixer registered (based on platform settings - graduated based on quantity over time)
Must be a Fixer or Client on the system (to understand how the platform works)

Evaluate this and propose a design for review, consider Agent as just another role, or separated as described here. What are the pros and cons
