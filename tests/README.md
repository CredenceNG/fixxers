## Key Interactions Tested

### 1. Service Request Creation
```typescript
- Client creates request with title, description, budget
- System validates required fields
- Request is marked as OPEN for fixer quotes
```

### 2. Quote Submission
```typescript
- Fixer submits quote with amount and estimated duration
- System prevents duplicate quotes
- Validates quote amount > 0
```

### 3. Quote Acceptance
```typescript
- Client reviews multiple quotes
- Accepts best quote
- System auto-rejects other quotes
- Order is created automatically
```

### 4. Payment & Escrow
```typescript
- Client makes payment
- Funds held in escrow
- Released to fixer on completion
- Auto-release after 7 days if no dispute
```

### 5. Order Workflow
```typescript
PENDING_PAYMENT → (payment) → PAID → (fixer starts) →
IN_PROGRESS → (fixer delivers) → DELIVERED →
(client approves) → COMPLETED
```

### 6. Messaging
```typescript
- Real-time communication between parties
- Attachment support
- Read receipts
- Unread counts
```

### 7. Reviews
```typescript
- Client reviews after completion
- Rating (1-5 stars) + optional comment
- Photo uploads (max 5)
- Fixer can respond
- Helpful votes from community
- Moderation for inappropriate content
```

## Business Rules Tested

1. **Budget Validation**: Service requests must have positive budget
2. **Quote Uniqueness**: One fixer can only submit one quote per request
3. **Quote Amount**: Must be greater than zero
4. **Order States**: Strict state transitions enforced
5. **Payment Escrow**: Funds held until work completion
6. **Review Timing**: Only after order completion
7. **Rating Bounds**: Must be between 1 and 5
8. **Cancellation Rules**:
   - Can cancel before payment (no refund needed)
   - Can cancel after payment (automatic refund)
   - Cannot cancel completed orders
9. **Dispute Freezing**: Payment frozen during active disputes
10. **Auto-Release**: Payments auto-release 7 days after delivery

## Commission Calculation

```typescript
Order Amount: $7500
Platform Fee (10%): $750
Fixer Earnings: $6750
```
