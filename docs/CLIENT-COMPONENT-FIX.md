# ðŸ”§ CLIENT COMPONENT DIRECTIVE ADDED

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** useState hook error in Server Component  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

---

## Problem

The referral page was throwing a runtime error:

```
TypeError: useState only works in Client Components. Add the "use client" directive at the top of the file to use it.

at ReferralCodeDisplay (components/quick-wins/QuickWinBadges.tsx:195:39)
```

**Root Cause:** The `ReferralCodeDisplay` component uses `useState` hook to manage the "copied" state for the copy button. However, it was being used in a Server Component context without the `"use client"` directive.

---

## Solution Applied

### Added "use client" Directive âœ…

Added the `"use client"` directive at the top of the QuickWinBadges component file:

**File:** `/components/quick-wins/QuickWinBadges.tsx`

```typescript
"use client";

/**
 * Quick Win Components
 * Ready-to-use components for immediate value features
 * Using inline styles for compatibility
 */

import React from "react";
```

This tells Next.js that all components exported from this file are Client Components, allowing them to use React hooks and browser APIs.

---

## Why This Works

### Next.js App Router Component Types:

1. **Server Components** (default)
   - Run only on the server
   - Cannot use hooks like useState, useEffect
   - Cannot access browser APIs
   - Better for data fetching and static content

2. **Client Components** (`"use client"`)
   - Run on both server (for initial render) and client
   - Can use all React hooks
   - Can access browser APIs (clipboard, localStorage, etc.)
   - Required for interactive components

### The ReferralCodeDisplay Component Needs:

- âœ… `useState` - to track copied state
- âœ… `navigator.clipboard` - to copy to clipboard
- âœ… `setTimeout` - to reset button text
- âœ… Event handlers - onClick

All of these require a Client Component!

## Files Modified

1. `/components/quick-wins/QuickWinBadges.tsx`
   - Added `"use client"` directive at top
   - Enables hooks and browser APIs in all badge components

---

## Component Architecture

```
/app/settings/referral/page.tsx (Server Component)
  â†“
  imports & renders
  â†“
/components/quick-wins/QuickWinBadges.tsx (Client Components)
  â”œâ”€â”€ ReferralCodeDisplay (uses useState âœ…)
  â”œâ”€â”€ AvailableNowBadge
  â”œâ”€â”€ ResponseTimeBadge
  â”œâ”€â”€ JobsCompleted
  â””â”€â”€ Other badges...
```

Server Component can import and render Client Components - this is the correct pattern!

**Status:** âœ… ALL ERRORS FIXED - Fully functional!
