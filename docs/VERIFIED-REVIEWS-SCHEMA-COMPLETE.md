# ‚úÖ Verified Reviews: Database Schema - COMPLETE!

**Completion Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Time Taken:** 15 minutes  
**Status:** üéâ **SCHEMA DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL**

---

## üéØ Summary

The database schema for verified reviews with photos has been successfully implemented and deployed to production. All new tables, fields, and relationships are now live and ready for application integration.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. **New Enum: ReviewReportStatus** ‚úÖ

```prisma
enum ReviewReportStatus {
  PENDING    // Initial state when report is submitted
  REVIEWING  // Admin is investigating
  RESOLVED   // Issue resolved (review removed/edited)
  DISMISSED  // Report deemed invalid
}
```

**Purpose:** Track the lifecycle of review reports for moderation

---

### 2. **Enhanced Review Model** ‚úÖ

**New Fields Added:**

```prisma
// Verified Review Fields
photos          String[]  @default([])  // UploadThing URLs
isVerified      Boolean   @default(false) // True if linked to completed order
isAnonymous     Boolean   @default(false) // Hide reviewer name

// Fixer Response
responseText    String?
respondedAt     DateTime?

// Engagement Metrics
helpfulCount    Int       @default(0)
reportCount     Int       @default(0)

// New Relations
helpfulMarks    ReviewHelpful[]
reports         ReviewReport[]
```

**New Indexes:**

- `@@index([isVerified])` - Fast filtering for verified reviews
- `@@index([createdAt])` - Efficient sorting by date

**Impact:**

- **Photos:** Support up to 5 photos per review via UploadThing
- **isVerified:** Distinguishes order-based reviews from general feedback
- **isAnonymous:** Privacy protection for sensitive reviews
- **responseText:** Allows fixers to respond professionally
- **Engagement:** Track helpful votes and reports for quality scoring

---

### 3. **New Model: ReviewHelpful** ‚úÖ

```prisma
model ReviewHelpful {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  reviewId    String
  review      Review    @relation(fields: [reviewId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId      String
  user        User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())

  @@unique([reviewId, userId])  // Prevent duplicate votes
  @@index([reviewId])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**Purpose:** Track which users found each review helpful

**Features:**

- One vote per user per review (unique constraint)
- Cascade deletion (removes votes when review/user deleted)
- Fast lookups by review or user

**Business Logic:**

- Users can mark reviews as "helpful"
- Most helpful reviews shown first in sorting
- Prevents vote manipulation (one vote per user)

---

### 4. **New Model: ReviewReport** ‚úÖ

```prisma
model ReviewReport {
  id          String              @id @default(cuid())
  reviewId    String
  review      Review              @relation(fields: [reviewId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  reportedBy  String
  reporter    User                @relation(fields: [reportedBy], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  reason      String              // Free text reason
  status      ReviewReportStatus  @default(PENDING)

  // Admin Resolution
  resolvedBy  String?
  resolvedAt  DateTime?
  resolution  String?             // Admin notes

  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt

  @@index([reviewId])
  @@index([reportedBy])
  @@index([status])
}
```

**Purpose:** Allow users to report inappropriate/fake reviews for moderation

**Features:**

- Free text reason field for detailed explanations
- Status workflow: PENDING ‚Üí REVIEWING ‚Üí RESOLVED/DISMISSED
- Admin resolution tracking (who resolved, when, notes)
- Fast filtering by status for admin dashboard

**Moderation Workflow:**

1. User reports review with reason
2. Status = PENDING
3. Admin reviews ‚Üí status = REVIEWING
4. Admin takes action ‚Üí status = RESOLVED/DISMISSED
5. Resolution notes stored for audit trail

---

### 5. **User Model Relations** ‚úÖ

**Added to User model:**

```prisma
reviewHelpful     ReviewHelpful[]
reviewReports     ReviewReport[]
```

**Purpose:**

- Track which reviews each user marked as helpful
- Track which reviews each user reported
- Enable user activity history

## üí° Technical Notes

### UploadThing Photo Storage

- Photos stored as array of URLs: `String[]`
- Example: `["https://uploadthing.com/f/abc123", "https://uploadthing.com/f/xyz789"]`
- Max 5 photos per review (enforced in application logic)
- 5MB max per photo (enforced by UploadThing config)

### Verified Review Logic

```typescript
// When creating review from completed order:
await prisma.review.create({
  data: {
    orderId: order.id,
    isVerified: true, // ‚Üê Automatically verified
    // ... other fields
  },
});
```

### Anonymous Review Display

```typescript
// Frontend logic:
{review.isAnonymous ? (
  <span>Anonymous Client</span>
) : (
  <span>{review.reviewer.name}</span>
)}
```

### Helpful Count Increment

```typescript
// When user marks review as helpful:
await prisma.reviewHelpful.create({
  data: { reviewId, userId },
});

await prisma.review.update({
  where: { id: reviewId },
  data: { helpfulCount: { increment: 1 } },
});
```
