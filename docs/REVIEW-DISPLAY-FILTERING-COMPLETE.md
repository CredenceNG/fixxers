## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Helpful Voting System

**File:** `/app/api/reviews/[reviewId]/helpful/route.ts` (111 lines)

**Features:**

- ✅ **POST Endpoint**: Toggle helpful marks (add/remove)
- ✅ **GET Endpoint**: Check if user marked review as helpful
- ✅ **Junction Table**: ReviewHelpful with unique constraint
- ✅ **Atomic Updates**: Transaction-based count updates
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: One helpful mark per user per review

**API Endpoints:**

```typescript
POST / api / reviews / [reviewId] / helpful;
// Toggles helpful mark
// Returns: { success: true, action: "added"|"removed", helpfulCount: number }

GET / api / reviews / [reviewId] / helpful;
// Returns: { isHelpful: boolean }
```

**Business Logic:**

- If user hasn't marked helpful → Create ReviewHelpful + increment count
- If user has marked helpful → Delete ReviewHelpful + decrement count
- All operations in transaction for data consistency

### 2. Report System

**File:** `/app/api/reviews/[reviewId]/report/route.ts` (96 lines)

**Features:**

- ✅ **POST Endpoint**: Submit review reports
- ✅ **Validation**: Reason 10-500 characters required
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: One report per user per review
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Reports created with PENDING status

**API Endpoint:**

```typescript
POST / api / reviews / [reviewId] / report;
// Body: { reason: string }
// Returns: { success: true, message: "Report submitted..." }
```

**Validation:**

- Reason must be 10-500 characters
- Cannot submit duplicate report (400 error if exists)
- Queues for admin moderation (Task 7)
