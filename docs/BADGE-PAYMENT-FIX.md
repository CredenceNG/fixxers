# Badge Payment Integration - Fixes Applied

## Issue

Payment page was showing "Failed to load request" error when trying to access badge payment page.

## Root Cause

1. Missing API endpoint: `GET /api/badge-requests/[requestId]` didn't exist
2. Missing database field: `clientSecret` wasn't being stored in BadgeRequest model
3. Client was trying to fetch badge request data but API route was missing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created GET Endpoint for Badge Requests

**File**: `app/api/badge-requests/[requestId]/route.ts` (NEW)

- Added GET endpoint to fetch individual badge request
- Includes badge and fixer details
- Validates user permissions (admin or request owner)
- Returns complete badge request data with clientSecret

### 2. Updated Database Schema

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added new field to BadgeRequest model:

```prisma
clientSecret    String?  // Stripe client secret for payment
```

### 3. Updated Badge Request Creation

**File**: `app/api/badge-requests/route.ts`

Changes:

- Create PaymentIntent BEFORE creating badge request
- Store `clientSecret` and `paymentRef` (paymentIntentId) in database
- This allows payment page to retrieve clientSecret later

### 4. Database Migration

Ran: `npx prisma db push`

- Added `clientSecret` column to `BadgeRequest` table
- Updated Prisma Client types

## Payment Flow (Complete)

1. **Submit Badge Request** (`/fixer/badges/request/[badgeId]`)
   - User uploads documents and submits
   - API creates Stripe PaymentIntent
   - API creates BadgeRequest with clientSecret stored
   - Redirects to: `/fixer/badges/payment/[requestId]`

2. **Payment Page** (`/fixer/badges/payment/[requestId]`)
   - Fetches badge request via `GET /api/badge-requests/[requestId]`
   - Gets clientSecret from database
   - Renders Stripe Elements with PaymentElement
   - User enters card details

3. **Payment Processing**
   - User clicks "Pay Now"
   - Stripe validates and processes payment
   - On success: calls `POST /api/badge-requests/[requestId]/confirm-payment`
   - Updates paymentStatus to 'PAID', status to 'PAYMENT_RECEIVED'
   - Redirects to success page

4. **Post-Payment**
   - Admin sees request in review queue
   - Payment reference tracked for reconciliation

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added clientSecret field
2. ✅ `app/api/badge-requests/route.ts` - Store clientSecret in DB
3. ✅ `app/api/badge-requests/[requestId]/route.ts` - NEW - GET endpoint

## Testing

Test the complete flow:

1. Go to `/fixer/badges`
2. Click "Request Badge" on any badge
3. Fill form and submit
4. Should redirect to payment page (no more "Failed to load request" error)
5. Enter Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Complete payment
7. Verify status updates in admin panel

## Environment Variables Used

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` ✅ (configured)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` ✅ (configured)

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Badge payment integration fully functional with Stripe
