## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Server Components (Default)

- `/app/settings/page.tsx` - Layout + static content
- `/app/settings/referral/page.tsx` - Data fetching + layout

### Client Components ('use client')

- `/app/settings/SettingsForm.tsx` - Interactive settings form
- `/components/quick-wins/ShareableReferralLink.tsx` - Copy link functionality
- `/components/quick-wins/QuickWinBadges.tsx` - Badge components with interactions

### Benefits of This Architecture

✅ **Performance:** Reduced JavaScript bundle size  
✅ **SEO:** Server-rendered content  
✅ **DX:** Clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Maintainability:** Easy to locate interactive vs static code

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Server/Client Boundaries:** Next.js 15 enforces strict separation - keep pages as Server Components, extract interactive parts
2. **Prisma Relations:** Always use nested select syntax for relations
3. **Color Properties:** Flat structure prevents nested access errors
4. **Inline Styles:** More reliable than Tailwind for cross-boundary components
5. **Incremental Testing:** Test after each change to catch errors early
6. **Documentation:** Real-time documentation prevents context loss

**The referral system is fully operational and production-ready.** All core functionality works, navigation flows smoothly, and the architecture follows Next.js 15 best practices. The system successfully:

✅ Generates unique referral codes for all users  
✅ Provides shareable links with social integration  
✅ Tracks referral relationships in the database
