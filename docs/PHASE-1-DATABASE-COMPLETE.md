# 🎯 Phase 1 Complete: Database Schema & Foundation

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Phase:** 1 of 5  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Spent:** ~3 hours

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema Design ✅

Added **3 new Prisma models** to `schema.prisma`:

#### **Badge Model**

- Stores the 5 badge types and their configurations
- Fields: type, name, description, icon, cost, requirements, expiry
- Supports both manual (paid) and automatic (earned) badges
- Includes criteria for Quality Performance badge

#### **BadgeRequest Model**

- Tracks fixer badge requests from submission to approval/rejection
- Fields: fixer, badge, status, documents, payment, admin review
- Supports document uploads via JSON storage
- Payment tracking with Paystack/Flutterwave integration ready

#### **BadgeAssignment Model**

- Records active badge assignments to fixers
- Fields: fixer, badge, validity dates, revocation details
- Supports expiry tracking and renewal
- Links to original request (if manually requested)

---

### 2. Enums Added ✅

Added **5 new enums**:

```prisma
enum BadgeType {
  IDENTITY_VERIFICATION
  INSURANCE_VERIFICATION
  BACKGROUND_CHECK
  SKILL_CERTIFICATION
  QUALITY_PERFORMANCE
}

enum BadgeRequestStatus {
  PENDING           // Awaiting payment
  PAYMENT_RECEIVED  // Paid, awaiting review
  UNDER_REVIEW      // Admin is reviewing
  APPROVED          // Approved, badge assigned
  REJECTED          // Rejected
  EXPIRED           // Request expired (30 days unpaid)
}

enum BadgePaymentStatus {
  PENDING
  PAID
  REFUNDED
}

enum BadgeStatus {
  ACTIVE
  EXPIRED
  REVOKED
}

enum BadgeTier {
  BRONZE    // 1-2 badges
  SILVER    // 3-4 badges
  GOLD      // All 5 badges
  PLATINUM  // All 5 + Top 5%
}
```

---

### 3. User Model Updates ✅

Extended User model with badge-related fields:

```prisma
// Trust Badges
badgeTier         BadgeTier?      // Calculated based on active badges
lastTierUpdate    DateTime?

// Trust Badges Relations
badgeRequests     BadgeRequest[]   @relation("FixerBadgeRequests")
badges            BadgeAssignment[] @relation("FixerBadges")
reviewedRequests  BadgeRequest[]   @relation("ReviewedBadgeRequests")
revokedBadges     BadgeAssignment[] @relation("RevokedBadges")
```

---

### 4. Database Migration ✅

Successfully pushed schema to PostgreSQL:

```bash
npx prisma db push
# ✅ Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema
```

Tables created:

- ✅ `Badge`
- ✅ `BadgeRequest`
- ✅ `BadgeAssignment`

---

### 5. Initial Badge Data ✅

Created and ran seed script: `prisma/seeds/badges.ts`

**5 Badges Seeded:**

| Badge                  | Icon | Type                   | Cost   | Expiry    |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Identity Verified      | 🆔   | IDENTITY_VERIFICATION  | ₦2,000 | 12 months |
| Insurance Verified     | 🛡️   | INSURANCE_VERIFICATION | ₦3,000 | 12 months |
| Background Verified    | ✅   | BACKGROUND_CHECK       | ₦5,000 | 12 months |
| Certified Professional | 📜   | SKILL_CERTIFICATION    | ₦2,500 | 24 months |
| Top Performer          | ⭐   | QUALITY_PERFORMANCE    | FREE   | 3 months  |

Seed output:

```
🏅 Seeding badges...
✓ Created badge: Identity Verified (🆔)
✓ Created badge: Insurance Verified (🛡️)
✓ Created badge: Background Verified (✅)
✓ Created badge: Certified Professional (📜)
✓ Created badge: Top Performer (⭐)
✅ Badge seeding complete!
```

---

### 6. Utility Functions ✅

Created `lib/badges/badge-utils.ts` with essential functions:

**Tier Calculation:**

- `calculateBadgeTier()` - Determine fixer's tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- `checkTopPerformerStatus()` - Check if in top 5% of performers
- `updateFixerBadgeTier()` - Update fixer's tier in database

**Badge Eligibility:**

- `checkQualityPerformanceCriteria()` - Check if qualifies for Quality badge
- `getFixerActiveBadges()` - Get all active badges for a fixer

**Display Helpers:**

- `getBadgeDisplayName()` - Get tier-specific display name
- `getTierColor()` - Get hex color for tier styling
- `formatBadgePrice()` - Format kobo to Naira display
- `isExpiringSoon()` - Check if badge expires within 30 days

## 📊 Database Schema Diagram

```
User (Fixer)
    ↓
    ├─→ BadgeRequest ──→ Badge
    │       ↓
    │   (Admin Review)
    │       ↓
    └─→ BadgeAssignment ──→ Badge
            ↓
        (Active/Expired/Revoked)
```

**Flow:**

1. Fixer creates **BadgeRequest** for a **Badge**
2. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
3. On approval: **BadgeAssignment** created
4. Badge appears on fixer's profile
5. Badge can expire or be revoked

---

- **2 new User fields** added
- **4 new User relations** added

### Performance Considerations

- ✅ Indexes added on frequently queried fields
- ✅ JSON used for flexible document storage
- ✅ Cascade delete configured for data consistency

## 🎯 Phase 1 Success Criteria

| Criterion                 | Status      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Database schema designed  | ✅ Complete |
| Prisma models created     | ✅ Complete |
| Migration successful      | ✅ Complete |
| Initial badges seeded     | ✅ Complete |
| Utility functions created | ✅ Complete |
| Type safety verified      | ✅ Complete |

**Overall: ✅ 100% COMPLETE**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Phase 2

**Phase 2: Badge Request Flow (Fixer UI)**

Tasks:

1. Create badge browsing page (`/fixer/badges`)
2. Badge request form with document upload
3. Payment integration (Paystack)
4. Request submission API endpoints
5. Request tracking dashboard

**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Schema Design:** Using `BadgePaymentStatus` separate from `PaymentStatus` avoids enum conflicts
2. **Flexibility:** JSON storage for documents allows different badge types to have different requirements
3. **Performance:** Top 5% calculation is expensive - should be cached or run as cron job
4. **Expiry:** Using nullable `expiresAt` allows both expiring and permanent badges

---

## 📝 Notes

- Quality Performance badge is **automatic** - no payment required
- Badge costs stored in **kobo** (multiply by 100 for Naira)
- Badge expiry is **optional** - some badges may not expire
- Admin can **revoke** badges at any time
- Badge tier is **calculated** based on active badges

---

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Ready for Phase 2:** ✅ **YES**  
**Next Action:** Build Fixer Badge Request Flow
