## üéØ What's Next? (Prioritized)

### **Immediate Priority: Finish Quick Wins**

Since Quick Wins is 90% done, let's finish the last 10%:

#### Task 1: Add Badges to Category Pages (1-2 hours) ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
**Why:** Category pages are high-traffic entry points  
**What:** Add the same badges to `/categories/[category]` pages  
**Effort:** Low (reuse existing components)

#### Task 2: Response Time Tracking on Quote Creation (30 min)
**Why:** Start collecting data for new quotes  
**What:** Update quote creation API to track response times  
**Effort:** Very low (utilities already exist)

#### Task 3: Response Time Cron Job (1 hour)
**Why:** Keep metrics fresh  
**What:** Daily job to recalculate averages  
**Effort:** Low (batch update utility exists)

#### Task 4: Profile Pages Badge Integration (2-3 hours)
**Why:** Complete badge coverage  
**What:** Add badges to fixer profile pages  
**Effort:** Medium (similar to gig pages)
