## 💰 Payment Integration Notes

### Current Implementation (Simulated)

- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Verification flow
- ✅ UI/UX complete

### Production Ready (Requires Paystack API Keys)

To go live with real payments:

1. Add to `.env`:

```env
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
```

2. Update `/api/badge-requests/[requestId]/payment/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Replace simulation with actual Paystack initialization
const response = await fetch("https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: user.email,
    amount: badgeRequest.paymentAmount, // in kobo
    reference: paymentRef,
    callback_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/fixer/badges/requests/${badgeRequest.id}`,
  }),
});
```

3. Update verification to call Paystack verification endpoint

**Estimated Integration Time:** 2-3 hours
