### 2. Automated Sending (Cron Job)

#### Cron Endpoint (`/app/api/cron/send-review-emails/route.ts`)

- **Route**: POST `/api/cron/send-review-emails`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3 AM UTC
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with `CRON_SECRET`
- **Process**:
  1. Fetch orders eligible for review requests (3 days old)
  2. Send review-request emails to clients
  3. Fetch orders with expiring windows (27 days old)
  4. Send review-expiring emails to clients
  5. Log sent/failed counts
  6. Return summary JSON

#### Error Handling

- Skips orders with missing client emails
- Logs individual failures without stopping process
- Returns detailed error messages per order
- Email sending errors don't fail review creation

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T03:00:00.000Z",
  "results": {
    "reviewRequests": {
      "sent": 5,
      "failed": 1,
      "errors": ["Order xyz: Client has no email"]
    },
    "expiringReminders": {
      "sent": 3,
      "failed": 0,
      "errors": []
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalSent": 8,
    "totalFailed": 1
  }
}
```

### 3. Review Creation Integration

#### Updated `/app/api/reviews/create/route.ts`

- Added email notification after successful review creation
- Sends review-received email to fixer
- Includes full review details (rating, comment excerpt, service)
- Handles anonymous reviews properly
- Graceful failure (logs error but doesn't fail review creation)

### 4. Review Window Utilities Enhancement

#### Updated `/lib/utils/review-window.ts`

- Enhanced `getOrdersEligibleForReviewRequest()`:
  - Now includes `request` and `gig` relations
  - Returns service title for email personalization
- Enhanced `getOrdersWithExpiringReviewWindow()`:
  - Now includes `request` and `gig` relations
  - Returns service title for email personalization

### 5. Configuration & Environment

#### Vercel Cron Configuration (`vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/send-review-emails",
      "schedule": "0 3 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Environment Variables (`/.env.example`)

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend email service API key
- `CRON_SECRET`: Secret key for authenticating cron jobs
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Base URL for email links

### 6. Dependencies

- **@react-email/components**: Email template components (Html, Body, Button, etc.)
- **@react-email/render**: Server-side email rendering
- **resend**: Email sending service (v6.1.2)
- **date-fns**: Date calculations for review window

## Email Flow Architecture

### Client Journey

1. **Day 0**: Order completed
2. **Day 3**: Receives "review-request" email (friendly reminder)
3. **Day 27**: Receives "review-expiring" email (urgent reminder)
4. **Day 30**: Review window closes (no more emails)

### Fixer Journey

1. Client submits review
2. Fixer receives "review-received" email immediately
3. Email includes rating, comment preview, response tips
4. Link to dashboard to view full review and respond

## Technical Implementation

### Email Rendering

```typescript
const emailHtml = await render(
  ReviewRequestEmail({
    clientName: order.client.name || "Valued Customer",
    fixerName: order.fixer.name || "Service Provider",
    serviceName,
    orderId: order.id,
    reviewUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/orders/${order.id}/review`,
    daysRemaining,
  })
);
```

### Email Sending (Resend)

```typescript
await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Fixxers <noreply@fixxers.com>",
  to: order.client.email,
  subject: `Share your experience with ${order.fixer.name}`,
  html: emailHtml,
});
```

### Cron Authentication

```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get("authorization");
if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

## Security Measures

1. **Cron Authentication**: Bearer token prevents unauthorized execution
2. **Email Validation**: Skips orders with missing client emails
3. **Error Isolation**: Individual email failures don't stop batch processing
4. **Rate Limiting**: Daily schedule prevents spam
5. **Opt-out Ready**: Email structure supports future unsubscribe functionality

## Testing Checklist

To test the email system:

### 1. Manual Email Testing

```bash
# In development, trigger cron manually:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/cron/send-review-emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```

### 2. Create Test Orders

```sql
-- Create test order completed 3 days ago
UPDATE "Order" SET "updatedAt" = NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days', status = 'COMPLETED' WHERE id = 'test-order-1';

-- Create test order completed 27 days ago
UPDATE "Order" SET "updatedAt" = NOW() - INTERVAL '27 days', status = 'COMPLETED' WHERE id = 'test-order-2';
```

### 3. Test Review Submission

1. Navigate to `/orders/{orderId}/review`
2. Submit a review with rating and comment
3. Check fixer's email for review-received notification

### 4. Verify Resend Dashboard

- Check sent emails in Resend dashboard
- View email previews
- Monitor delivery rates
- Check for bounces/failures

## Email Design Best Practices

1. **Mobile-Responsive**: All templates use responsive design
2. **Inline Styles**: Email client compatibility
3. **Clear CTAs**: Prominent action buttons
4. **Fallback Content**: Text alternatives for images
5. **Professional Branding**: Consistent Fixxers branding
6. **Accessibility**: Proper heading structure, alt text

## Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**: Cron processes all eligible orders at once
2. **Async Sending**: Emails sent asynchronously without blocking
3. **Error Recovery**: Failed emails logged but don't stop process
4. **Database Queries**: Optimized with specific date ranges
5. **Daily Schedule**: Off-peak hours (3 AM UTC)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Unsubscribe Functionality**: Add opt-out for review emails
2. **Email Preferences**: Allow users to choose notification types
3. **A/B Testing**: Test different subject lines and content
4. **Email Analytics**: Track open rates, click-through rates
5. **Reminder Customization**: Allow fixers to customize reminder timing
6. **Multi-language Support**: Translate emails based on user locale
7. **Email Templates Editor**: Admin UI to edit email content
8. **Scheduled Digest**: Weekly digest of reviews for fixers
