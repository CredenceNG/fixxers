  ‚≠ê My Reviews
</DashboardButton>
```

**Purpose:**

- Links fixers to their review management page
- Shows all reviews needing responses
- Displays response rate tracking
- Enables quick access to review response features

**Location:** Actions section with other navigation buttons

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)

```

**Purpose:**

      style={{ borderLeft: `4px solid ${colors.error}`, padding: "20px" }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          alignItems: "center",
          justifyContent: "space-between",
        }}
      >
        <div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}>
          <div style={{ flexShrink: 0 }}>
            <svg
              style={{ height: "24px", width: "24px", color: colors.error }}
              viewBox="0 0 20 20"
              fill="currentColor"
            >
              <path
                fillRule="evenodd"
                d="M3 6a3 3 0 013-3h10a1 1 0 01.8 1.6L14.25 8l2.55 3.4A1 1 0 0116 13H6a1 1 0 00-1 1v3a1 1 0 11-2 0V6z"
                clipRule="evenodd"
              />
            </svg>
          </div>
          <div style={{ marginLeft: "16px" }}>
            <p
              style={{
                fontSize: "15px",
                color: colors.textPrimary,
                fontWeight: "600",
              }}
            >
              {stats.pendingReports} review report
              {stats.pendingReports !== 1 ? "s" : ""} awaiting moderation
            </p>
            <p
              style={{
                fontSize: "13px",
                color: colors.textSecondary,
                marginTop: "4px",
              }}
            >
              Review reported content and take appropriate action
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <Link href="/admin/reports">
          <DashboardButton variant="outline">Review Reports</DashboardButton>
        </Link>

    </DashboardCard>
  );
}
