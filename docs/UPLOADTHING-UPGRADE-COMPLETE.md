# UploadThing Upgrade Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully upgraded UploadThing integration from legacy configuration to modern API with proper token-based authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables

- **Removed**: `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` (legacy)
- **Updated**: Now using `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` (modern base64 encoded JSON)
- **Format**: Token contains `{ apiKey, appId, regions }` in base64 encoding

### 2. Client Configuration (`lib/uploadthing.ts`)

```typescript
// BEFORE (Legacy)
import { genUploader } from "uploadthing/client";

// AFTER (Modern)
import { genUploader } from "uploadthing/client";
export const { uploadFiles, createUpload } = genUploader<OurFileRouter>();
```

### 3. Server Configuration

- **Core** (`app/api/uploadthing/core.ts`): Already modern ✅
- **Route** (`app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`): Uses automatic token detection ✅

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated `docs/UPLOADTHING-SETUP.md` with modern token setup
- Updated `.env.example` with new token format

## Token Format

### Legacy (Removed)

```env
UPLOADTHING_SECRET="sk_live_xxxxx"
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="app_id"
```

### Modern (Current)

```env
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN="eyJhcGlLZXkiOiJza19saXZlX...[base64 JSON]"
```

The token is a base64 encoded JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "sk_live_xxxxx",
  "appId": "app_id",
  "regions": ["sea1"]
}
```
