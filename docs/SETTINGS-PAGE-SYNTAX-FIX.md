# Settings Page Syntax Error Fix

## Issue

Build error in `/app/settings/page.tsx`:

```
Parsing ecmascript source code failed
  11 |       actions={
  12 |         <SettingsForm />
> 13 |       </ div>
     |        ^^^^^^
  14 |     </DashboardLayoutWithHeader>
  15 |   );
  16 | }

Unterminated regexp literal
```

## Root Cause

The settings page file became corrupted with:

1. **Invalid JSX syntax**: `</ div>` with a space between `</` and `div`
2. **Duplicate content**: Same JSX blocks repeated multiple times
3. **Broken structure**: Multiple closing tags without matching opening tags
4. **Incomplete component**: File had 270 lines of duplicated/corrupted JSX

The corruption likely occurred during a previous edit attempt where content was duplicated instead of replaced.

## Solution

Recreated the file from scratch with clean, properly formatted JSX:

```bash
rm /Users/itopa/projects/nextjs-fixxers/app/settings/page.tsx
cat > /Users/itopa/projects/nextjs-fixxers/app/settings/page.tsx << 'EOF'
# ... clean file content ...
EOF
```

## Final Working Structure

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import { colors } from '@/lib/theme';
import DashboardLayoutWithHeader from '@/components/DashboardLayoutWithHeader';
import SettingsForm from './SettingsForm';

export default function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <DashboardLayoutWithHeader
      title="Settings"
      subtitle="Manage your notification preferences and account settings"
      actions={
        <Link href="/settings/referral" style={{...}}>
          üéÅ View Referrals
        </Link>
      }
    >
      <div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
        {/* Referral banner */}
        <div style={{...}}>...</div>

        {/* Settings form (Client Component) */}
        <SettingsForm />
      </div>
    </DashboardLayoutWithHeader>
  );
}
```

## Key Points

1. **Server Component**: No 'use client' directive - keeps page as Server Component
2. **Clean JSX**: All tags properly closed with no spaces in closing tags
3. **Proper Props**: `actions` prop receives a Link component, not a broken fragment
4. **Single Export**: One clean function with proper structure
5. **80 Lines**: Down from 270 lines of duplicated content

## Verification

‚úÖ Dev server starts without errors
‚úÖ File compiles successfully
‚úÖ No parsing errors
‚úÖ Clean JSX structure maintained

## Prevention

When editing files:

- Use `replace_string_in_file` tool with unique context strings
- Verify changes with `read_file` after editing
- If file becomes corrupted, recreate from scratch rather than attempting multiple fixes
- Always include proper closing tags without spaces: `</div>` not `</ div>`
