## üí° Technical Notes

### 30-Day Window Logic

```typescript
const completionDate = order.updatedAt; // Using updatedAt as proxy
const expiresAt = addDays(completionDate, 30);
const daysRemaining = differenceInDays(expiresAt, new Date());

if (isPast(expiresAt)) {
  // Window expired
}
```

**Note:** In production, consider adding a dedicated `completedAt` field to Order model for precise tracking.

### Anonymous Review Display

```typescript
// Frontend logic (for later display task):
{review.isAnonymous ? (
  <span>Anonymous Client</span>
) : (
  <span>{review.reviewer.name}</span>
)}

// But review is still marked as isVerified=true
```

### Review Verification

All reviews created through this flow are automatically marked as `isVerified: true` because they're linked to completed orders (provable transactions).
