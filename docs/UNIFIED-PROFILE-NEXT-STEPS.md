# Unified Profile - Current Status & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** Step 1 in progress (basic profile form) - debugging submission issue

---

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Page loads successfully** at `/profile`
2. **Old routes redirect** properly (`/client/profile` and `/fixer/profile` → `/profile`)
3. **Form displays correctly** with all basic fields
4. **Data pre-population** works (name from registration)
5. **Location cascading dropdowns** work (country → state → neighborhood)
6. **Server/client component separation** fixed

---

## ❌ Current Issue

**Profile submission failing** - form submits but profiles are not created in database.

**Error from frontend**: "Failed to save profile. Please try again."

**Next debugging step**: Need to see the actual API error from the server logs.

**Test user**: `fixi-test1@yopmail.com` (ACTIVE, has CLIENT+FIXER roles, no profiles yet)

---

## 📋 Two-Step Approach (Option B - Approved)

### Step 1: Basic Profile (Current - 95% complete)
**Page**: `/profile`
**Fields**:
- ✅ Basic Information (name, phones, alt email)
- ✅ Location (country, state, neighborhood, street address)
- ✅ For FIXER: Years of Service, Qualifications

**Creates**:
- ClientProfile (if CLIENT role)
- FixerProfile (if FIXER role)
- Shared fields match between both profiles

**Current blocker**: Submission failing - need to debug API

---

### Step 2: Services & Areas (Not started - 0% complete)
**Page**: `/fixer/services` (to be created)
**Fields**:
- Service Categories & Subcategories (multi-select with hierarchy)
- Service Neighborhoods (where fixer operates - multi-select checkboxes)

**Creates**:
- FixerService entries (links fixer to subcategories)
- Service-Neighborhood associations

**Benefits of separate page**:
- ✅ Better UX - not overwhelming
- ✅ Can be completed later
- ✅ Easier to update services anytime
- ✅ Clear focus on each step

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. `app/profile/page.tsx` - Server component (fetches data)
2. `app/profile/UnifiedProfileForm.tsx` - Client form (728 lines)
3. `app/api/profile/route.ts` - Unified API endpoint

### Infrastructure
4. `middleware.ts` - Redirects to `/profile`
5. `app/client/profile/page.tsx` - Redirects to `/profile`
6. `app/fixer/profile/page.tsx` - Redirects to `/profile`

### Testing
7. `test-unified-profile.ts` - Basic automated tests
8. `test-e2e-unified-profile.ts` - E2E tests

### Documentation
9. `UNIFIED-PROFILE-STATUS.md` - Status report
10. `UNIFIED-PROFILE-NEXT-STEPS.md` - This file

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Server/client component separation** - Moved DashboardLayoutWithHeader to server page
2. ✅ **Prisma schema mismatch** - Removed non-existent includes (neighborhoods, services)
3. ✅ **Spelling inconsistency** - Fixed `neighbourhood` → `neighborhood` in API calls

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Debug Profile Submission (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Action**: Add console.log to API endpoint to see exact error
- **Or**: Check browser network tab for API response
- **Or**: Try manual curl test to API endpoint

### 2. Once Step 1 Works
- Test with `fixi-test1@yopmail.com`
- Verify both profiles created
- Verify shared fields match
- Commit Step 1

### 3. Then Build Step 2
- Create `/fixer/services` page
- Service categories/subcategories selection UI
- Service neighborhoods selection UI
- API endpoint to create FixerService entries
- Link from profile/dashboard to services page

## 💡 Why Two-Step Approach is Better

**Original Problem**: Adding services to unified form would make it 900-1000 lines with ~30+ form fields - overwhelming!

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure
- **Step 1**: Core profile info everyone needs (quick, simple)
- **Step 2**: Service-specific details only fixers need (focused, detailed)

**User Experience**:
1. New fixer registers → completes basic profile → redirected to services setup
2. Can skip services setup initially if needed
3. Can edit/update services anytime from dedicated page
4. Clear, focused UI at each step

**Developer Experience**:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Easier to test each step independently
- Services page can be enhanced independently
