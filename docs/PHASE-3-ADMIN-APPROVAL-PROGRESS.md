## ⚠️ Known TypeScript Errors

The following TypeScript errors are expected (will resolve after `npx prisma generate`):

1. `Property 'badgeRequest' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'`
2. `Property 'badgeAssignment' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'`
3. `Property 'badgeTier' does not exist in type 'UserUpdateInput'`

**These are IDE-only errors.** Runtime will work after Prisma schema is synchronized.
