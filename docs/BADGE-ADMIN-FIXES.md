# Badge Admin Approval/Rejection Fixes

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Null ExpiryMonths Handling
**Problem:** When a badge has `expiryMonths` set to `null` (for badges that don't expire), the approval route would fail trying to calculate expiry date.

**Location:** [app/api/admin/badge-requests/[requestId]/approve/route.ts:53-60](../app/api/admin/badge-requests/[requestId]/approve/route.ts#L53-60)

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (line 54-55):
const expiresAt = new Date();
expiresAt.setMonth(expiresAt.getMonth() + badgeRequest.badge.expiryMonths); // Error when null

// After (line 54-60):
const expiresAt = badgeRequest.badge.expiryMonths
  ? (() => {
      const date = new Date();
      date.setMonth(date.getMonth() + badgeRequest.badge.expiryMonths);
      return date;
    })()
  : null; // Properly handles null expiry
```

---

### 2. ✅ Missing RequestId in Badge Assignment
**Problem:** When creating a badge assignment, the `requestId` field was not being populated, breaking the relationship between the assignment and the original request.

**Location:** [app/api/admin/badge-requests/[requestId]/approve/route.ts:71-80](../app/api/admin/badge-requests/[requestId]/approve/route.ts#L71-80)

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (line 71-79):
const assignment = await tx.badgeAssignment.create({
  data: {
    fixerId: badgeRequest.fixerId,
    badgeId: badgeRequest.badgeId,
    // Missing: requestId
    status: "ACTIVE",
    assignedAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt,
  },
});

// After (line 71-80):
const assignment = await tx.badgeAssignment.create({
  data: {
    fixerId: badgeRequest.fixerId,
    badgeId: badgeRequest.badgeId,
    requestId: badgeRequest.id, // ✅ Added
    status: "ACTIVE",
    assignedAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt,
  },
});
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Badge Approval
```bash
# Navigate to admin badge requests page
http://localhost:3010/admin/badges/requests

---

### 2. Test Badge Rejection
```bash

# Enter rejection reason (required)
# Submit
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Badge request status changes to `REJECTED`
- ✅ Rejection reason saved
- ✅ Email sent to fixer with rejection details
- ✅ Refund amount shown if payment was made

---

### 3. Test Request More Info
```bash
# Navigate to a badge request detail page

# Submit
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Badge request status changes to `MORE_INFO_NEEDED`
- ✅ Admin notes saved

   - Show timeline of admin actions

4. **SLA tracking**

## Troubleshooting

### Badge approval fails with "Badge request not found"
- Check that the request ID in the URL is correct
- Verify the badge request exists in the database

### Badge approval fails with "Payment has not been confirmed"
- Check `paymentStatus` field is `PAID`
- Verify webhook processed the payment correctly
- Check Stripe dashboard for payment status

### Emails not sending
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check fixer has a valid email address
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs
- Look for console errors in server logs

### "Unauthorized" error
- Verify user is logged in as admin
- Check user's roles include `ADMIN`
- Clear cookies and login again
